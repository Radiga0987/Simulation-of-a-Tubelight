We model a tubelight as a one dimensional space of gas in
which electrons are continually injected at the cathode and accelerated towards
the anode by a constant electric field.We simulate the tubelight over a given
number of turns(timesteps) starting with no electrons initially. The electrons
can ionize atoms if they have a velocity greater more than some given threshold
velocity, leading to an emission of a photon,but this a probabilistic process.We
plot various aspects of this simulated tubelight like electron densities and intensities.
